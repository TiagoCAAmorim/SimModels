Created for a project for a developed field, at the management stage. This case consists of a model with six vertical producers and seven vertical injectors with 2161 days of production and injection history, including WAG-CO2 cycles. It has geological and operational characteristics of Brazilian pre-salt fields, consisting of a light-oil carbonate reservoir with high CO2 content.
