Test on the effect of changing the wells' ff.

* The 2024 and 2026 GEOMETRY keywords have different ff values, but the wells are the same (except the 2nd phase wells, only present in 2026).
* Most ff values are greater than the unity (up to ~4), but there are smaller values (down to ~0.6). These seem to change by well completion interval.
* Two additional tests were performed:
    * All ff equal to unity.
    * Using the file from the 2026 version of Unisim IV.
